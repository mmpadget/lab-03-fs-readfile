# Lab 3: Node Fs Read File

## Tasks
- [x] Make a lib and test directory.
- [ ] Read three files and console log the first 8 bytes in hex of each file.
- [ ] Guarantee that three files are read and console logged in order 'one.txt', 'two.txt', 'three.txt' regardless of file size.
- [ ] Write tests that guarantee that the files are logged in order.
- [ ] Look up and implement async testing, making sure that you are not getting "false positives" (tests that are passing but shouldn't be).

## Stretch
* Don't use nested callbacks.

## Documentation
* [Node File System](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/fs.html)

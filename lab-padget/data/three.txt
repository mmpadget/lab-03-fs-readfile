You have to make these big decisions. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun You can get away with a lot.

No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Happy painting, God bless. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.

Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.

Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. This is the fun part Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? That's a son of a gun of a cloud.

And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Let all these things just sort of happen. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? This piece of canvas is your world. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.

Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. I'm a water fanatic. I love water.

Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?

Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Let's make a happy little mountain now. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. In your world you can create anything you desire.

You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. And just raise cain. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Those great big fluffy clouds. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.

It's important to me that you're happy. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.

Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.

It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. That's crazy.

There it is. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness.

See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.

Let's have a little bit of fun today. Just make little strokes like that. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself.

It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. You're meant to have fun in life. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow.

We wash our brush with odorless thinner. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Anything you want to do you can do here. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. You can spend all day playing with mountains.

Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Be brave.

We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities.

Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. You gotta think like a tree. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Just relax and let it flow. That easy.

Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Imagination is the key to painting. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. This painting comes right out of your heart. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it.

Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.

For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. A happy cloud.

With practice comes confidence. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.

If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.

We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. In this world, everything can be happy.

In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.

Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Just use the old one inch brush. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. In your world you have total and absolute power.

We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it.

Get tough with it, get strong. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Let's build some happy little clouds up here.

The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. And right there you got an almighty cloud. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.

Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.

And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. What the devil. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.

Work that paint. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.

We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.

Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let's build an almighty mountain. Have fun with it.

Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Let the paint work. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. There we go. We don't have anything but happy trees here.

Let's get wild today. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. This is unplanned it really just happens.

Here's something that's fun. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart.

Every day I learn. We'll make some happy little bushes here. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate.

A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Very easy to work these to death. There are no limits in this world.

There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. We don't want to set these clouds on fire.

We'll do another happy little painting. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. See there, told you that would be easy. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Working it up and down, back and forth. Don't fiddle with it all day.

A little happy sunlight shining through there. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Just beat the devil out of it.

Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Don't be bashful drop me a line. At home you have unlimited time.

We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. See there how easy that is. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way.

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Isn't that fantastic? Let's do it again then, what the heck. Take your time. Speed will come later.

Use your imagination, let it go. Let's do that again. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here.

That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Let's get crazy. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.

Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. I want everybody to be happy. That's what it's all about.

You are only limited by your imagination. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Don't fight it, use what happens.

I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.

No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. This is truly an almighty mountain. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted.

Poor old tree. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there.

You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do.

The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Just make a decision and let it go. Brown is such a nice color. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.

Do an almighty painting with us. Let your heart be your guide. We'll play with clouds today.

All kinds of happy little splashes. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow.

Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Let that brush dance around there and play. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.

They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers just to upset the critics. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Every time you practice, you learn more. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.

And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.

Put it in, leave it alone. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is.

You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things.

These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Use what you see, don't plan it. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.

Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. A beautiful little sunset. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Let's have a happy little tree in here. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.

Here we're limited by the time we have. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds.

All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. This is your world.

This is gonna be a happy little seascape. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. We'll have a super time.

This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. You can create anything that makes you happy. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.

In life you need colors. Son of a gun. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.

Trees grow however makes them happy. It is a lot of fun. The light is your friend. Preserve it. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen.

We'll paint one happy little tree right here. The least little bit can do so much. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Everybody needs a friend.

Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.

If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Only eight colors that you need. We have a fantastic little sky!

You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Fluff that up. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Now then, let's play.

Even the worst thing we can do here is good. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Learn when to stop. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.

Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue We need dark in order to show light. You need the dark in order to show the light.

Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. There comes a nice little fluffer.

It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. Let your imagination be your guide. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. We can fix anything. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.

Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. You can do it. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.

I like to beat the brush. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.

As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear.

We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. You can do anything your heart can imagine.

Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. Anyone can paint. Let your imagination be your guide. You have to make these big decisions. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun

You can get away with a lot. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Happy painting, God bless. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.

Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. This is the fun part Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.

It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? That's a son of a gun of a cloud. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right.

Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Let all these things just sort of happen. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? This piece of canvas is your world. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.

Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here.

I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?

Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Let's make a happy little mountain now. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light.

If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. See.
